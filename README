This is a port of Arto Salmi's 6809 simulator.  Minor changes have been
made to get it to work in the way that I would like.  This program
remains licensed under the GNU General Public License.

Included are some sample C programs built with the gcc6809 compiler
to demonstrate how to create a program from scratch.

The simulator includes some memory-mapped registers for I/O; see
prog/libsim.h for more information.

==========================================================================

Original README text from Arto:


simple 6809 simulator under GPL licence 

NOTE! this software is beta stage, and has bugs.
To compile it you should have 32-bit ANSI C complier.

This simulator is missing all interrupt related SYNC, NMI Etc...

I am currently busy with school, thus this is relased.
if you have guestion or found something funny in my code please mail me.

have fun!
